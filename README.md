# Capstone_share
This repo contains codes for simulating monte calo algorithm for data preprocessing turned to data processing .Most of the codes and simulations are estimation of pi base models.
# Phases of the repo 
phase 1 -Simulation of classical monte carlo
phase 2 -attempting to optimize classical monte carlo with a different sampling methord
phase 3 -optimizing with markov chain and multi markov chain 
phase 4 -increasing the dimensions to 3D
phase 5 -attemting to implement custom problems like weather patterns and alzheimer's
phase 6 -implementing the base estimation of with quantum computing algorithms
# implementation procedure plan ?
-pure quantum monte carlo 
-converting classical to quantum via tensor networks 
# Additional proposition 
-modifying the base algorithm of markov chains with greedy algorithm and icing model
-purpose : mathematically integrating the algorithms for better performance 
# Final goals that must be acheived other goals are optional
-a working quantum algoritm that works on pure quantum computer not a quantum computer simulation
-comparision of performance metrics like error%,time comparision between classical and quantum
-find the best possible metric configurations
-if possible achieve a middle ground and a hybrid model that gets good acceptable metrics
