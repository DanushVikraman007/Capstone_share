# Capstone_share
This repo contains codes for simulating monte calo algorithm for data preprocessing turned to data processing .Most of the codes and simulations are estimation of pi base models.
# Phases of the repo 
phase 1 -Simulation of classical monte carlo
phase 2 -attempting to optimize classical monte carlo with a different sampling methord
phase 3 -optimizing with markov chain and multi markov chain 
phase 4 -increasing the dimensions to 3D
phase 5 -attemting to implement custom problems like weather patterns and alzheimer's
phase 6 -implementing the base estimation of with quantum computing algorithms
phase 7 -combining mcmc and greedy controlled via simulated annealing for a custom data prioritization algoithm 
# implementation procedure plan ?
add a case where greedy can be quantumized by grovers amplitude amplification 
# Goals/applications 
Get the algorithm to prioritize the high quality data points based on conditions given or search the dataset for points that match the description 
potentially lower energy consuming ml algorithms 
proposed name - YO -(Yukthi opus)
